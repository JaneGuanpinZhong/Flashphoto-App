## High-Level Design

## Coding style

- Not only the coding ideas are important, but also the coding style matters a
lot! There is a discussion of the most important rules of coding style
that I enforce within the project. It includes conventions for naming
variables, documenting code, use of namespaces. Go to that page and learn more
about how to make codes beautiful!

## Common Tasks

Here we go! There is a tutorial written for you that describes what you would
need to do in order to add a new filter to the project. Follow the steps and it
should be easy to create a brand new filter by yourdelf!
