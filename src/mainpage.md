**Flashphoto** and **Mia**.

Below are **two tutorials**. <br/>

to use them easily and quickly by going through the tutorial.
- The other one is for programmers who are willing to learn how to make
them. There are major ideas, detailed codes and methods about the two
applications. You can build your own painting applications by going through the
